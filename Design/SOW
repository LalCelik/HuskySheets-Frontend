Statement of Work:
Description of project:

The team aims to create a version of Google Spreadsheets called HuskSheets using Java for both backend and frontend operations 

MVP:
Creation:
Users can make a new sheet
The sheet is a set of cells that have numeric or character values
Users should be able to see the sheets created by other users
Should be able to create a new user (register a new user)
User should be able to open previously created sheets
Should be able to delete a sheet
Sheet:
Users should be able to edit the sheet and have the new data persisted in saved files

Being able to add more columns or rows to the initial sheet
Cells Selection - Copy, Paste, Delete

Additional Features (Bonus)
Being able to color cells and change fonts
Being able to create a graph from selecting two columns/rows
Freezing a column
Format as currency button
Rounding decimal numbers (rounding up to a certain digit)

Hidden bonus:
Predictive text

User stories and use cases:
A use case example
Name: Create user account
Actor: User
Stakeholders and Interests:
User: Wants to register an account with HuskSheets
System: Needs to ensure the user account exists after registration and that all sheets associated with the user are consistent.
Preconditions: The user has not created an account with the system but has opened the system. 
Postconditions: The user account is saved with their corresponding data
Basic Flow:
Register: The system provides the user with a register dialog box that allows the user to input their user-specific information.
Register Error Handling: The system checks for invalid user information (account already exists, email address invalid, etc.) when the user asks to register their account. If no invalid information is provided, the account can be registered and saved with the system. 
Login: Users can log in using the credentials they previously provided to register their account. 
User Profile: Once logged in, users can continue to interact with the sheets they have created. 
Extensions (Alternative Flows):
Error Handling:
If a user has not registered their account with the system, an error dialog box will appear preventing the user from logging into their account. 
If a user has provided invalid information while registering for their account, an error message will appear preventing the user from registering an account. 
Special Requirements:
The system should not allow duplicate user accounts. 
Open Issues:
What is the identifier for a user account that associates a user to their sheets? 
A use case example
Name: Plot graphs
Actor: User
Stakeholders and Interests:
User: Wants to plot graphs given cell information
System: Needs to accommodate graphing coordinates.
Preconditions: There needs to be valid input that can be considered an (x,y) coordinate
Postconditions: The graph can be visualized directly on the sheet or saved as a png. 
Basic Flow:
Coordinate input: The user must provide valid integers in at least one cell of two separate columns (forming at least a single x-y coordinate).
 Register Error Handling: The system checks for invalid user input (user has provided a letter input, user has selected empty column, etc) when the user asks to plot the graph. If no invalid information is provided, the graph can be plotted.
Graph: User can drag their cursor across the cells contained in two columns, which are parsed as separate lists of x and y coordinates. Pressing the “Plot Graph” button allows the graph to be plotted. 
 Final Plot: System displays a dialog box with the plotted graph and provides the option to save the graph as a png. 
Extensions (Alternative Flows):
Error Handling:
If a user has provided invalid or no information for plotting, an error message will appear preventing the user from plotting the graph. 
Special Requirements:
The system allows graphing functionality. 
Open Issues:
Will a user be able to plot multiple kinds of graphs or just a simple plot?
Name: Sort sheet
Actor: User
Stakeholders and Interests:
User: Wants to easily sort columns or rows based on a certain criteria 
System: Needs to ensure data integrity and provide accurate sorted data back to the user.
Preconditions: The user is logged into the application and has opened or created a sheet with a given name. The sheet has columns and rows filled out. 
Postconditions: The sheet has sorted columns/rows defined by the user.
Basic Flow:
Start Sort Process: The system saves the project with the cells as inputted. 
Provide Sort Options: If the user wants to sort, provide different options such as alphabetically, increasing numbers, etc.
System Validates and Sorts: The system checks for errors (e.g., sorting numbers alphabetically, a mix of different data types ); Assuming no errors, the system saves the sheet.
Confirm Sort to User: The system provides visual feedback that the sorting process has started; Upon successful sort, the system displays the sorted data
Extensions (Alternative Flows):
Error Handling:
If saving fails due to an error, the system alerts the user and returns to the sheet to allow the user to re-try. 
Special Requirements:
The application should handle large sheets.
Sort operations should not significantly impact application performance.
Open Issues:
What if we cannot provide a certain sorting algorithm?


Name: Functions for Simple Calculations
Actor: User
Stakeholders and Interests:
User: Wants to do simple calculations through the use of pre-defined functions
System: Needs to provide timely feedback to the user.
Preconditions: The user is logged into the application and has opened or created a sheet with a given name. The user has selected and is working on a specific cell.
Postconditions: The cell is showing the output of the function, but has the actual function inside
Basic Flow:
User edits the cell: The user double-clicks the cell to start editing the cell. (There will be an edit state and a show state for each cell).
User uses a function: User uses one of IF, SUM, MIN, MAX, AVG, CONCAT, and DEBUG functions.
Finish editing and show output: The user clicks away or presses enter, then the output of the function will be shown on the cell.
Extensions (Alternative Flows):
Error Handling:
If the function does not work, the cell shows the error message.
Special Requirements:
The application should handle large values.
Function operations should not significantly impact application performance.
Open Issues:
What if the user tries to use a function that doesn’t exist?
What if there are undefined math behaviors?
What if the syntax of the function is wrong?
Name: Customizing cells
Actor: User
Stakeholders and Interests:
User: Wants to easily change the font style and/or font size of the text within the cells
System: Needs to ensure that the data is persisted in the font customizations its changed to
Preconditions: The user is logged into the application and has opened or created a sheet. (and there is text already in the cell?)
Postconditions: The text in cells is a different font style from the default.
Basic Flow:
Highlight the cells in which the font styles should be changed
As soon as the user chooses a new font style or size, the text should be automatically changed
Extensions (Alternative Flows):
Error Handling:
There should be no edge cases in this scenario
Special Requirements:
Can change the font styles of multiple cells at the same time
Open Issues:
How many options will be available to users to choose from?
Name: View Sheet Changes
Actor: User
Stakeholders and Interests:
User: Wants to be able to see changes made by other users to a shared sheet.
System: Must ensure collaboration and provide updates on the sheets when one of the users decides to save their changes. The changes won’t be viewed in real-time, but updated consistently.

Preconditions: The user is logged into the application and has opened a shared sheet.
Postconditions: The user can view the latest changes made by other users to the sheet.
Basic Flow:
Change Saving: The system tracks changes made by other users.
View Changes: The user should be able to view the changes made by another user when they are committed.
Accept or Reject Changes: Depending on the settings, the user may have the option to accept or reject the changes made by other users.
Extensions (Alternative Flows):
Error Handling:
If there are any issues with retrieving or displaying changes, the system notifies the user.
Special Requirements:
The application should support concurrent editing by multiple users without conflicts.
Changes should be synced across all devices in real-time.
Open Issues:
How to handle conflicts when multiple users attempt to edit the same cell simultaneously?
A use case example
Name: Save sheet
Actor: User
Stakeholders and Interests:
User: Wants to easily save changes to a sheet
System: Needs to ensure data integrity and provide timely feedback to the user.
Preconditions: The user is logged into the application and has opened or created a sheet with a given name.
Postconditions: The sheet is saved with the latest changes.
Basic Flow:
Start Save Process: The system periodically saves the document according to the set frequency without user initiation.
Provide Save Options: If this is the first save for this document, the system prompts whether to save it locally or on the server; The user selects the option.
System Validates and Saves: The system checks for errors (e.g., insufficient storage, permission issues); Assuming no errors, the system saves the sheet.
Confirm Save to User: The system provides visual feedback that the saving process has started; Upon successful save, the system displays a success message.
Extensions (Alternative Flows):
Error Handling:
If saving fails due to an error (e.g., no space, no permission), the system alerts the user and suggests possible fixes.
The system does not overwrite any previously saved state until the issue is resolved.
Special Requirements:
The application should handle large sheets.
Save operations should not significantly impact application performance.
Open Issues:
What backup solutions are in place in case of system failure during a save?
